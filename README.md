# Solar-Energy-System-with-Power-Monitoring
A portable 5V USB charging system that utilizes a 6V solar panel to charge a Li-ion battery. The system integrates an ESP32 and an ACS712 current sensor to provide real-time monitoring of the power generated by the solar panel.
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, off-grid renewable energy solution, combining principles of power electronics, embedded systems, and instrumentation. The core of the system is a Waveshare solar power management module that handles efficient battery charging (using MPPT) and provides a stable, boosted 5V output.

To add data analysis capabilities, an ESP32 microcontroller is used to read data from an ACS712 current sensor placed in-line with the solar panel. The ESP32 calculates the real-time current (Amps) and power (Watts) being generated, and prints this data to the serial monitor for analysis. This showcases a practical application of instrumentation in evaluating the performance of a renewable energy source.

Components Used
Power Management: Waveshare Solar Power Manager (14500 Version)

Energy Storage: 14500 3.7V Li-ion Battery

Energy Source: 6V, 3W Solar Panel

Monitoring System: ESP32 Development Board

Sensor: ACS712 Hall-Effect Current Sensor (5A Module)

Circuit & Wiring
The system is assembled in two main parts. First, the core solar charger is built using the Waveshare board, battery, and panel. Second, the monitoring circuit is added by placing the ACS712 sensor between the solar panel and the Waveshare board, with the sensor's output being read by the ESP32
